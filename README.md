**KerbealisticDocking**

- This mod is a simple Module Manager patch, applied to all docking ports, modded or not, and changes their behaviour so that they have much less  "attractive force" when docking. It also lowers the distance at which the said force starts to kick in. It alters other values as well such as the "undocking force" (more in the .cfg / cf. KSP doc on ModuleDockingNode)
- In a way, this makes docking harder since you need to be much more precise, slow and well aligned.
- But It also makes it feel smoother, more natural and realistic (You've seen ISS docking right ? ^^ ).
- It has the QOL benefit for your spacecrafts / stations to not make them rotate randomly anymore, when docked, which can be quite annoying.
- It is inspired by Realism Overhaul configs, credit goes to them for doing this in the first place.
